This is a source code for a hybrid hazard-based models using two-piece distributions. 
We proposed parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric regression functions for the time-scale and relative hazard-scale change. 
Three parametric baseline distirbutions with  a log-link function are included in the code: TPA normal, TPA logistic and TPA Laplace distributions.
